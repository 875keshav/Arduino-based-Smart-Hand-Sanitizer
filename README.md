### Introduction:
A smart hand sanitizer is a device that provides an automated and touchless hand sanitizing experience. It is designed to dispense hand sanitizer without the need for physical contact, reducing the risk of spreading germs and viruses.


### Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. Servo Motor
4. LCD display
   
### Circuit Diagram:
